# Exercise: Using Command-Line Arguments in Bash
# Requirements
- Create a new Bash script in the same directory as this script. 
- Name the script arguments.sh.
- The script should start with a shebang line specifying /bin/bash as the interpreter.
- The script should accept a single command-line argument.
- If a command-line argument is provided, the script should print "Hello, ARGUMENT", where ARGUMENT is the provided command-line argument.
- If no command-line argument is provided, the script should print "No argument provided."
- Ensure the arguments.sh script is executable.
