# Requirements
- Create a new Bash script in the same directory as this script. 
- Name the script conditionals.sh.
- The script should start with a shebang line specifying /bin/bash as the interpreter.
- Define a variable named GREETING in the script and assign it the value "Hello, World!".
- The script should include a conditional statement.
- If the GREETING variable is "Hello, World!", print "Greeting is correct.". Otherwise, print "Greeting is incorrect."
- Ensure the conditionals.sh script is executable.
