# Requirements
- Create a new Bash script in the same directory as this script. 
- Name the script arguments.sh.
- The script should start with a shebang line specifying /bin/bash as the interpreter.
- The script should accept three command-line arguments.
- The script should print the first argument, followed by the second argument, then followed by the third argument, each on a separate line.
- Ensure the arguments.sh script is executable.
