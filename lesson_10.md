# Exercise: Loops in Bash
# Requirements
- Create a new Bash script in the same directory as this script. 
- Name the script loop.sh
- The script should start with a shebang line specifying /bin/bash as the interpreter.
- The script should define an array named 'fruits' containing the following elements: "Apple", "Banana", "Cherry".
- The script should use a loop to iterate over each element in the 'fruits' array.
- Inside the loop, the script should print each element of the 'fruits' array, each on a separate line.
- Ensure the loop.sh script is executable.
