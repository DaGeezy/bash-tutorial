# Exercise: Using Loops in Bash
# Requirements
- Create a new Bash script in the same directory as this script. 
- Name the script loops.sh
- The script should start with a shebang line specifying /bin/bash as the interpreter.
- The script should include a for loop that iterates over numbers 1 through 5.
- For each iteration, the script should print "Iteration number: X", where X is the current number.
- Ensure the loops.sh script is executable.
